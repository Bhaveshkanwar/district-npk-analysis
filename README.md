# District-npk-analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis on District-Level Fertilizer Usage in India.


#🌟 Project Overview
"District-Level Fertilizer Usage Analysis in India" is a data science project that explores and visualizes the consumption of key agricultural fertilizers — Nitrogen (N), Phosphate (P), and Potash (K) — across Indian districts over multiple years. Using real-world data sourced from ICRISAT, this project aims to uncover spatial and temporal trends, detect outliers, identify top-performing regions, and analyze the correlation between fertilizer usage metrics.

Through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a wide variety of data visualization techniques (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, violin plots, etc.), we gain valuable insights into how fertilizers are utilized across different states and districts of India, how usage patterns change over time, and which areas consume the most.


This data science project dives deep into the district-level consumption of fertilizers in India, focusing on **NPK usage**:

- 🧪 Nitrogen (N)
- 🧪 Phosphate (P)
- 🧪 Potash (K)

Using real data from **ICRISAT**, we perform a **full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and identify trends, outliers, top regions, and correlations — all with beautiful visualizations.



## 🔍 Key Insights & Features

✨ **Distribution Analysis**: Histogram, KDE, Boxplot  
🌍 **State & Year-wise Trends**: Violin plots, Line plots  
📈 **Correlation Matrix**: Heatmap of NPK relationships  
🏆 **Top Districts by Usage**: Bar plots & stacked charts  
📊 **Total Usage vs Total Consumption**: Regression line  
🔥 **Interactive Visuals**: Pair plots, Pie chart, Heatmap



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**


🎯 Objectives
Analyze the distribution of N, P, and K fertilizers across districts.

Identify top districts based on total NPK usage.

Observe state-wise trends using time-series visualizations.

Detect outliers and unusual consumption patterns.

Study correlations between fertilizer types and their overall impact.

Visualize data using plots and heatmaps to make insights intuitive and engaging.
